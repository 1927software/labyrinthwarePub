Previously CutMap determined the grain orientation by inspecting how the material laid on the object. Because that could be imprecise, CutMap now manages the grain direction status explicitly using the <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> and <em>CutMap: Rotate material</em> commands (available in the context menu). You can also manage the grain direction completely yourself using the <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> command.<br><br>Please note that materials applied in previous versions of CutMap will no longer register the orientation correctly in CutMap 0.4. To fix this, reapply materials using the <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> command. However, you will probably want to first clear the existing material of an object using the new <em>CutMap: Remove material</em> command as <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> will not overwrite existing materials when multiple objects are selected.<br><br>Also note that the <em>CutMap: Rotate material</em> command only works on objects that are painted at the face level and not on objects that are painted at the object level. <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> always paints objects at the face level, so that may be your best choice for painting objects when you wish to rotate materials.<br><br>You can apply materials using the regular SketchUp methods (i.e., <em>not</em> using <em>CutMap: Apply material</em> and <em>CutMap: Rotate material</em>) and still specify the grain orientation to CutMap by using the <em>CutMap: Change orientation status</em> command.</div></div><br>2.

CutMap associates a part with a specific sheet by matching the material applied to an object in your model to a material assigned to a sheet. If you have not painted your model at all, or have painted it in materials not associated with the sheets you have selected for the project, then no parts will match-up with sheets and a cutlist will not be generated. The <a href="cutmap/doc/index.html?topic=materials">Using Materials</a> tutorial explains this in more detail.</p><p>Other reasons are:<ul><li>You have not selected sheets for the project in the CutMap <em>Go page</em> | <em>Project sheets</em> list box</li><li>The parts in the model are too large to fit in any of the project sheets</li></ul></p></div></div><a class="collapseBtn" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faqPartsInScene" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faqPartsInScene">Why are parts of my model showing up in the cutlist scene?&nbsp;<div class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></div><br></a><div class="collapse" id="faqPartsInScene"><div class="well"><p>The components or groups that are showing up in the cutlist scene are probably assigned to <em>Layer0</em>. <em>Layer0</em> is a special layer that is always visible in all scenes. Other layers are selectively visible in a scene. Cutlist scenes only show the layer that CutMap created for that cutlist (and, of course <em>Layer0</em>).</p><p>When creating objects (components or groups) for your model the best practice is to draw your geometry into <em>Layer0</em>, then when you <em>make</em> it into a component or group, to then assign <em>the object</em> to any layer other than <em>Layer0</em>. This strategy takes advantage of the fact that <em>Layer0</em> is always visible in all scenes, so if you ever need to explode an object the geometry is guaranteed to be visible. The object itself, however, will not be visible in <em>Layer0</em> which gives you the flexibility to show or hide it in specific scenes.</p><p>If you do find parts of your model in the cutlist scene it is easy to fix. Simply select the errant objects in the cutlist scene, open the <em>Entity Info</em> window (<em>Window</em> | <em>Entity info</em> menu item), and then select another layer from the <em>Layers</em> dropdown.</p></div></div><a class="collapseBtn" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faqNewMaterial" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faqNewMaterial">Why after I select a new material the name sometimes does not show up in the <em>CutMap: Apply Material</em> context menu item?&nbsp;<div class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></div><br></a><div class="collapse" id="faqNewMaterial"><div class="well"><p>If the material has not not been used in your model it is not possible for CutMap to discover the name. SketchUp just doesn't make the selection available until its been used in the model.</p><p>A workaround is to simply paint something in your model with the newly selected material. Now that the material is in the model it will show up in the menu item and in the <em>Materials</em> tab in the CutMap window. You can always remove the material later using the <em>CutMap: Remove material <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></span> all materials</em> context menu item.</p><p>Note that this isn't a problem with CutMap's default materials unless you have purged unused materials in your model.</p></div></div><a class="collapseBtn" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faqBlankMaterial" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faqBlankMaterial">Why are material patches in the CutMap window sometimes blank?<br></a><div class="collapse" id="faqBlankMaterial"><div class="well"><p>CutMap is not able to get the image of materials that are not used in your model. Once you paint something in your model with the material if will be available and CutMap will be able to show the patch. The CutMap default materials are added internally to your model so these images will always be available (unless you have purged unused materials in the model). The materials you add yourself do not get this treatment, however. In a future version of CutMap we may be able to make it an option to always add the custom materials you have assigned to sheet goods to the models you are using with CutMap.</p><p>A workaround is to simply paint something in your model using conventional SketchUp methods. After that the material will be available to CutMap and you will be able to use the CutMap material methods and shortcuts.</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-mid-9"><h1>Support</h1></div><hr><p>Please see our tutorials <a href="cutmap/doc/index.html">here</a> for help in using CutMap.</p><h4 style="margin-bottom: 0">Issues:</h4><a id="no_data_issue" class="collapseBtn" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faqCorruptData" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faqCorruptData">Erroneous data in CutMap window&nbsp;<div class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></div></a><div class="collapse" id="faqCorruptData"><div class="well"><p>If the data in the CutMap window looks incorrect, with missing information and empty material patches, then the CutMap data may have become corrupted.
