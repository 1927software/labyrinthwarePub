        <p>
          You can add dimension callouts to a cutlist using the SketchUp Dimension tool <img src="../../assets/48x48_dimension.png" style="width: 32px;">.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may find that you do not need dimension callouts at all, as the dimensions on
          each board will give you all the information you need to make your cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage of an in-model cutlist is that you can use the tools in SketchUp to create
          dimension callouts at any place you need a measurement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cutlist is a very precise
          map that you can use to plan a cutting strategy, that, depending on your tools, could
          involve initial general cuts followed by repeatable story-board type cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you need to create a dimension callout from the edge of a sheet use the small markers in the sheet corners for the start or end point. Please watch the video below for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SketchUp Tape Measure tool <img src="../../assets/48x48_measure.png" style="width: 32px;"> can be very useful to get quick distance measurements between points.
